## Context

`validate --profile prototyping` and `qfai prototyping certify` require reviewer
artifacts in mutually exclusive places for a multi-spec frozen set:

| gate                                 | layout                                   | payload                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `validate` reviewer-deliverable gate | flat `iter-NN/review.json`               | `EvaluatorReview` (`iterIndex`, `reviewerId`, `scores`, `proseCritique`, `pivotDirective`, `evidenceRefs`, …) |
| `certify` multi-spec branch          | `iter-NN/spec-NNNN/<screen>.review.json` | `ReviewerPayload` (`specId`, `screenId`, `cycle`, `ordinalAxes`, `impressions`, …)                            |

A project that satisfies `certify` fails `validate` with
`prototypingEvidence.review.missing` on every non-seed iteration.
`QFAI-PROT-002` is on `core/prototyping/mode.ts`'s hard-error list so
exploration mode does not soften it, and `certify` refuses to seal unless
`validate.json#counts.error === 0`. Uncertifiable either way.

This CR does **not** resolve which artifact is canonical. That decision is
deferred by the approval above; the CR exists because recording the deferral
touches `08_Open-questions.md`, which
`constitution/drift-protocol.md#core-rule` lists as upstream SSOT.

## Measured, so the deferral rests on facts

On `main` at `aa7bcd23`:

- `iterationReviewPathPerSpec` — **zero production callers**.
- `reviewerDispatch.ts` — **zero production callers**.
- `prototypingIterate.ts:828-839` freezes `frozenSpecsCovered` single-spec on
  purpose, and its comment names this contradiction as the reason: _"certify
  already hard-fails any multi-spec frozen set on the flat-iter layout, so
  persisting the full UI-bearing union here would render every normal
  multi-spec run uncertifiable."_ That freeze is the only thing holding the two
  gates apart — and what makes multi-spec prototyping unreachable.
- `scores` **is** `ordinalAxes`: the same four axes on the same four-value
  ordinal scale. `layoutAntiPatternsDetected` and `designMdViolations` are
  identical. Issue #1078 claimed otherwise and is corrected on the issue.
- `pivotDirective`, `evidenceRefs` and `reviewerId` are **absent from
  `ReviewerPayload` entirely**, so adopting the per-spec layout while keeping
  the flat gate's obligations means extending a contract-declared closed
  schema, not writing a mapping.

## Blocked downstream items

| Item           | Kind            | Why it depends on the artifact                                               |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OQ-0012-0006` | `open-question` | Per-spec iter-dir wire-in cannot land until the canonical artifact is chosen |
| `OQ-0012-0007` | `open-question` | Reviewer-dispatch wire-in has no stable target until then                    |
| `OQ-0012-0008` | `open-question` | `parseEvaluatorReview` runtime wire-in reads whichever wins                  |

- Not blocked: no ledger row, test or contract changes. This CR records a
  deferral; `src/` and `.qfai/contracts/**` are untouched.
- Overlapping open CRs: `none`

## Impact scope

- Specs: `spec-0012` (`08_Open-questions.md` only)
- Plans: `-`
- Tests: `-`
- Contracts: `-` (a change would be needed under options A and C; neither is
  chosen here)
- Schema: `-`

## Decision needed from user

Which review artifact is canonical — per-spec, flat, or both — or defer?

**Answered: defer.** Record the measured contradiction and leave code and
contracts as they are, paying the decision cost when a multi-spec frozen set is
actually needed.

## Approved actions (owner skill rerun plan)

1. `/qfai-sdd 0012` rerun scope: **`confirm-only`**. One open-question entry is
   appended by hand under the approval above; no acceptance criterion, business
   rule, example or test case changes, so there is no derivation to re-run.
2. Downstream ledger sweep: none. No `spec-0012` ledger row changes status,
   test file or selector.

## Resolution

Applied by hand under the approval above, `confirm-only`:

- `.qfai/specs/spec-0012/08_Open-questions.md` — `OQ-0012-0013` appended,
  disposition `deferred`, recording the contradiction, the five measured facts,
  the three options with their real costs, and the trigger that ends the
  deferral (the first multi-spec frozen set, or the OQ-0012-0006 / 0007
  wire-in).
- No other artifact is edited. In particular the single-spec freeze in
  `prototypingIterate.ts` stays exactly as it is: it is the mitigation, and
  `OQ-0012-0013` is the record that its comment is load-bearing.
