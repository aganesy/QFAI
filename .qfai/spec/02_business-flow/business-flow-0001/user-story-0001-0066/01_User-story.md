# US-0001-0066: Per-unit reports

## User Story

- Parent: CAP-0005
- Goal: After the report is generated, `writeSpecPackReports()` also writes a report per spec. On the story tree it writes one report per business flow instead
- Non-goals: Customising the format of the per-unit reports

## Legacy Source Scope

- In: every feature of the report command (`--format md|json`, `--base-url`, `--run-validate`, `--in`, `--out`, `--phase`, validate.json input, report.md/report.json output, spec-pack report generation), and the prototyping observability section (obligations, screenshot/html evidence, review artifact, validate/verify outcome, compatibility wording). On the story tree, the spec-pack reports become one report per business flow, and `--flow BF-NNNN` scopes a run to named business flows
- Out: validate/init/doctor/guardrails

## Source Provenance
