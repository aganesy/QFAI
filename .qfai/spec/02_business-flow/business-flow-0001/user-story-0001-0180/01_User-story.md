# US-0001-0180: Cross-skill handoff legacy adapter helper

## User Story

As a downstream-project operator on a legacy handoff file, I want `qfai handoff upgrade <legacy-file>` (SHOULD) to emit a conforming `handoff.yaml` at the canonical path while preserving all original fields under `legacy:`, so that migration to the CLI-HANDOFF schema is lossless during the deprecation window (REQ-0172).

## Legacy Source Scope

- In:
  - agent cards and routing framework
  - orchestrator protocol
  - delegation hard-stop rules
  - review profiles and gate rules
  - the shipped routing entry for `/qfai-migration-spec-to-story`
  - skill integration
  - prototyping evaluator/reviewer routing
  - `/qfai-prototyping` v2.0 routing rebuild: orchestrator → product-experience-architect (generator) + product-surface-reviewer (evaluator) + devops-ci-engineer (capture); same-Claude generator/reviewer is forbidden (self-preference bias)
  - the built-in review profiles contain `default` but no `full-harness`; no review-profile file is written into the project
- Out:
  - runtime execution engines
  - removed prototyping CLI behavior
