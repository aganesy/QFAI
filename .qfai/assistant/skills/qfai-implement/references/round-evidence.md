# Round Evidence

Per-round fields of the `qfai-implement` evidence contract. The skill's
`### Per-item evidence contract` section carries the summary.

## Round block

One block per RED/GREEN cycle. Round 1 is the original cycle; each blocking
reviewer `REVISE` that requires new production behaviour adds a round.

- `Round N: RED command` — the exact command executed to observe failure
- `Round N: RED result` — the failure output (result completeness is
  best-effort; truncated output is acceptable)
- `Round N: GREEN command` — the exact command executed to observe success
- `Round N: GREEN result` — the success output
- `Round N: reviewer verdict` — the verdict that closed the round (`PASS`, or
  `REVISE` plus the finding that opened round N+1). Absent on round 1 when no
  review has run yet.

## Single-round items

A single-round item satisfies the contract with `Round 1: ...` and no
reviewer-verdict line, which is the same content the previous one-pair
contract required. Nothing existing becomes non-conformant.

## Where the rounds happen

An item at `review-fix` may re-enter the RED/GREEN cycle as many times as the
rework needs. Each pass is its own round block. Returning to `refactor`
re-submits the item to the reviewer that opened the round.

## Resuming a `review-fix` item

A `review-fix` row can outlive the session that created it — the operator
interrupts, or the run ends between the `REVISE` and the rework. On the next
start, `review-fix` rows are selected **before** any `todo` row (Required
Process, Phase: Red, step 1), so an interrupted rework is always resumed
rather than stranded behind newer items.

Resuming a `review-fix` row:

1. Read the round blocks already in the item's evidence and take the highest
   `Round N`; the reviewer verdict on that round names the finding to fix.
2. Open round `N + 1` and run the RED/GREEN cycle for the rework.
3. Return the row to `refactor` and re-submit to the reviewer that opened the
   round.

A `review-fix` row must already have a `Test file` — it reached `refactor`
before the `REVISE`. `validateTddList` checks the file exists for
`review-fix` exactly as it does for `green`, `refactor` and `done`, so a
rework row that lost its test file is reported (`TDDLIST_TEST_FILE_MISSING`)
instead of being accepted as a valid ledger state.
