# Round Evidence

Per-round fields of the `qfai-implement` evidence contract. The skill's
`### Per-item evidence contract` section carries the summary.

## Round block

One block per RED/GREEN cycle. Round 1 is the original cycle; each blocking
reviewer `REVISE` that requires new production behaviour adds a round.

- `Round N: RED command` — the exact command executed to observe failure
- `Round N: RED result` — the failure output (result completeness is
  best-effort; truncated output is acceptable)
- `Round N: GREEN command` — the exact command executed to observe success
- `Round N: GREEN result` — the success output
- `Round N: reviewer verdict` — the verdict that closed the round (`PASS`, or
  `REVISE` plus the finding, and which rework path it took). Absent on round 1
  when no review has run yet.

## Single-round items

A single-round item satisfies the contract with `Round 1: ...` and no
reviewer-verdict line, which is the same content the previous one-pair
contract required. Nothing existing becomes non-conformant.

## Where the rounds happen

An item at `review-fix` may re-enter the RED/GREEN cycle as many times as the
rework needs. Each pass is its own round block.

**The row's `Status` stays `review-fix` throughout.** The RED/GREEN passes are
work, not ledger states here: `review-fix -> red` and `review-fix -> green` are
not allowed transitions, and writing either would be the backward transition
the lifecycle forbids. `review-fix -> refactor` is the only status change the
rework produces; the rounds themselves are recorded in `Evidence`.

## A `REVISE` that needs no new production behaviour

`implementation-reviewer` frequently returns `REVISE` for naming, duplication
or a comment — rework that changes no observable behaviour. There is no new
failing test to write, so opening a round would mean inventing a RED phase for
a change that has none. That rework takes the second path:

1. The status contract is unchanged: the row still moves
   `refactor -> review-fix` and back.
2. **No round is opened.** Round blocks record RED/GREEN cycles; a
   behaviour-preserving change has none.
3. Make the change, re-run the item's tests, and refresh
   `Refactor verify command` / `Refactor verify result`. That refreshed pair is
   the evidence the change kept GREEN, and it must be fresh — the pre-rework
   pair is stale evidence.
4. Record the trigger and the path taken on the current round's
   `Round N: reviewer verdict` line, then return to `refactor` and re-submit.

Which path applies is decided by the finding, not by the reviewer: a `REVISE`
that requires new production behaviour opens round N+1 even when it came from
`implementation-reviewer`.

## Who the rework goes back to

Returning to `refactor` re-submits the item to **every routed blocking reviewer
whose verdict the rework could invalidate** — always the reviewer that opened
the round, plus any reviewer that already returned `PASS` on artifacts the
rework changed. A `PASS` recorded against the pre-rework test or production
code is stale evidence: it does not count towards "After all routed blocking
reviewers return PASS" and must be re-earned before the item may reach `done`.

## Resuming a `review-fix` item

A `review-fix` row can outlive the session that created it — the operator
interrupts, or the run ends between the `REVISE` and the rework. On the next
start, `review-fix` rows are selected **before** any `todo` row (Required
Process, Phase: Red, step 1), so an interrupted rework is always resumed
rather than stranded behind newer items.

Resuming a `review-fix` row:

1. Read the round blocks already in the item's evidence and take the highest
   `Round N`; the reviewer verdict on that round names the finding to fix.
2. Pick the path the finding calls for: open round `N + 1` and run the
   RED/GREEN cycle when the fix needs new production behaviour, or take the
   behaviour-preserving path above when it does not.
3. Return the row to `refactor` and re-submit per **Who the rework goes back
   to** above.

A `review-fix` row must already have a `Test file` — it reached `refactor`
before the `REVISE`. `validateTddList` checks the file exists for
`review-fix` exactly as it does for `green`, `refactor` and `done`, so a
rework row that lost its test file is reported (`TDDLIST_TEST_FILE_MISSING`)
instead of being accepted as a valid ledger state.
