# SDD Phase Checklists

Use these checklists as the detailed operational guide for `/qfai-sdd`.

## Stage 1: Triage

- Active spec summaries collected; non-active specs filtered out.
- Each REQ/NFR has a classified Operation (one of the 8).
- UPDATE rows declare an explicit Sub-op (APPEND / MODIFY / REMOVE).
- Approval-required rows (CREATE / DELETE / SPLIT / MERGE / SUPERSEDE / UPDATE:REMOVE) carry a recorded `Approved By`.
- Triage table written to `<spec>/09_delta.md` (per-spec) and `_policies/10_delta.md` (cross-spec / policy).
- Stop entry to Phase 0 until the Triage table is complete.

## Phase 0: Contracts-first

- Confirm impacted contract kinds: API, DB, UI.
- Create or update declared contract files.
- Ensure each contract has `QFAI-CONTRACT-ID`.
- Refresh `_policies/05_Contracts.md` Contract Index.
- Stop if an indexed contract file is missing.

## Phase 1: Outline

- Refresh `_policies/01..11`.
- Keep Mermaid inside fenced code blocks only.
- Mirror every unresolved shared issue into `_policies/09_Open-questions.md`.
- Record `0 items` explicitly when decisions or delta are empty.

## Phase 2: Slice

- Create or update `<spec-id>/01..08`.
- Check `US -> AC -> BR -> EX -> TC`.
- Ensure `01_Spec.md` remains the execution Primary SSOT.
- Stop if slice gate fails.

## Phase 3: Plan finalize

- Create or update `<spec-id>/10_Plan.md`.
- Keep the file How-only.
- Do not finalize the plan before at least one slice gate passes.

## Phase 4: Delta update

- Update `09_delta.md` or `*_delta.md`.
- Record adoption and rejection rationale.
- When rejections exist, include `DO NOT` and `Temptation`.
