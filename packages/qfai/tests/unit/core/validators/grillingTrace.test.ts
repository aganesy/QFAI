/**
 * `QFAI-GRILL-001` — a spec stage whose mandatory grilling session left no trace.
 *
 * The failure it exists for leaves nothing else behind: a stage that ran its
 * session and one that skipped it produce the same spec pack, the same
 * coverage, the same work orders. The only difference is the record the stage
 * was told to write, so that record's absence is the finding.
 *
 * The quiet side is pinned as heavily as the loud one. A warning that fires
 * where nothing is owed is one people learn to scroll past, and then the one
 * that matters goes with it.
