/**
 * E2E: the layered CI scaffold an adopter receives (spec-0017)
 *
 * `spec-0017` has two halves. The first is QFAI's own CI, which
 * `tests/scripts/ownWorkflowTopology.test.ts` and `tests/scripts/workflowHygiene.test.ts` assert
 * against `.github/workflows/**` directly. The second is the half a user story is about: **the same
 * scaffold in the templates QFAI ships, so an adopter receives it rather than rebuilding it.** That
 * half has exactly one end-to-end surface — run `qfai init` into an empty project and read what
 * arrives — and this file is it.
 *
 * `US-*` is answered from `<testsDir>/e2e/**` (`catalog/test-layers.md`, `QFAI-ATDD-111`), so the
 * nine annotations below are this spec's US coverage. Before this file there were none, and the gate
 * reported all nine.
 *
 * ## What each row establishes, and what it does not
 *
 * Measured against the shipped tree before writing a line of this file. Four of the nine user
 * stories are satisfied in `assets/init/root/.github/workflows/**` today; five are not:
 *
 *     US-0017-0001  detection job + verdict over toJSON(needs)      SHIPPED
 *     US-0017-0002  SHA pins, persist-credentials: false            SHIPPED
 *     US-0017-0003  no workflow-level Node version literal          SHIPPED
 *     US-0017-0009  the layer-to-CI-lane map                        SHIPPED
 *     US-0017-0004  build reuse + upload hygiene                    no surface: 0 uploads, 0 builds
 *     US-0017-0005  layer lanes without a new check name            5 separate JOBS, not matrix legs
 *     US-0017-0006  a hygiene lint lane pull requests run           not invoked by the shipped set
 *     US-0017-0007  parallelism knobs derived from the workload      no knob file ships
 *     US-0017-0008  the duplicate validate workflow retired          qfai-validate.yml still ships
 *
 * The four satisfied ones are asserted on their substance. The five unsatisfied ones are **not**
 * asserted as absences: a test pinning "no hygiene lane is invoked" would fail the day someone
 * correctly adds one, which is a test that punishes its own fix. Each instead asserts the INVARIANT
 * its user story depends on and which stays true after the gap closes — the trigger a lint lane
 * would run on, the single-workflow shape a matrix would live in, and so on.
 *
 * That difference is the point of the Coverage Depth Matrix, and it is recorded there rather than
 * flattened here: `.qfai/evidence/coverage-depth-spec-0017.md` carries a `❌` per unsatisfied story
 * with the ledger rows that would close it.
 *
 * `runInit` once, shared. Nine inits of a full asset tree is nine times the same work, and this
 * spec's own integration slice was pushed past its timeout by exactly that shape.
