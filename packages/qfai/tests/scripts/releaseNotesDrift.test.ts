/**
 * A published release body, held against the changelog section it was built
 * from.
 *
 * The release workflow cuts the section out of `CHANGELOG.md` at the tagged
 * commit and creates the release once. An entry added to that section
 * afterwards is in the repository and not in the notes anyone reads, and
 * nothing noticed.
 *
 * Three decisions carry the check, and the cases are about them: which
 * sections are compared, what counts as an entry, and what a body the workflow
 * had to cut is allowed to be missing.
